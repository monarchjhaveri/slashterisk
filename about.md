I'm Monarch Wadia, a self-taught software developer and all-around coding geek. I'm passionate about a lot of things when it comes to code, but the thing that keeps me busy on weekdays is building software for other businesses.

I've worked with lots of frontend and backend technologies -- I guess that makes me what they call a "Full Stack Developer". I love Java for how easy it makes it to build software for enterprises; Ruby for its cleanliness of syntax and for the productivity machine that is Rails; and JavaScript for its amazing community and the sheer versatility it offers. HTML5 is my playground, and I enjoy React just as much as I enjoy Angular 2. I'm also a big fan of Webpack.

I love scifi, sailing, and music. However, for better or for worse, programming is my number hobby.

If you'd ever like to get in touch, [hit me up](../standing-invitation). I'll even buy you coffee if you're in Toronto.
