Your programming skills depend on more than just knowledge, skill and hard work. It’s equally, if not more, important to nurture an attitude towards your work that allows you to excel consistently on a daily basis. Generally, people identify this attitude as a “passion” or “love” for programming, and it makes its presence known in the way a developer talks about code; there’s just something different, something energizing, when you talk to someone who is really into what they do. All things being equal, a “passionate” programmer will always get hired over someone who looks at programming as “just a job”.

There is an “inner game” aspect to programming that is unwise to ignore. Outer game is your skillset and knowledge, and the application of that skillset and knowledge on a project to produce code. Inner game consists of the abovementioned attitude/passion, your work ethic, and also how you view yourself as a developer. It’s the self-talk that surrounds and supports skills, knowledge and application of effort. Without effective and well-regulated self-talk, you will probably burn out like so many software engineers have before you. The biggest enemies to your inner game are overwork and boredom, and these can quite literally kill you in extreme cases.

I have in the past suffered programming burnout after working too hard for too long. 12 hour days, 7 days a week means I’m working two full time jobs; it doesn’t matter if I’m working on a personal project or if I’m writing code for my employer at the time; the net effect is all the same. After a while, you get tired of programming and you don’t even want to look at code, let alone write it.

I've also burnt out from working on boring projects. Projects that offered very little in the way of interesting, challenging work. You could call it "reverse burnout". This happens when you're solving problems that are very easy for you to solve, either because they're actually easy problems or because you've grown accustomed to those types of problems through experience and repetition. When you're in a situation like that, you'll feel your skills rusting in near-real time. The best way to deal with a situation like that is to either sculpt the work to be more interesting and challenging, or to quit.

If you’re feeling overworked, bored, or just damned tired of programming, the best thing for you to do is to turn your laptop off and go take a walk. Blow off some steam. Come back after half an hour and check how you’re feeling when looking at code. If you’re not into it, do something else or take the day off if possible. Come back the next day, or the day after that if you can help it. Get plenty of sleep if you can. And lay off the caffeine, it just won’t do you any good in the long run. And don't work on boring projects -- they're bad for the soul.
