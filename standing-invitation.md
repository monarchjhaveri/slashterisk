Computers have given me more than I deserve -- but a wise man (my father) once taught me the value of human connections and, the self improvement geek that I am, I've been trying to make up for lost time ever since.

...but I still love software. I live and breathe software. I drink and dream software. And I love to talk software.

So, taking a page from [Patrick McKenzie's ~~book~~ blog](http://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation/), I'm issuing a standing invitation. Here we go:

**If you want to talk software, I want to talk to you.**

The best way to reach me is probably at my email address, monarch @t zeroprojects d0t ca. You can very easily find me on LinkedIn, Github and Twitter. I do Hangouts, but can also do Skype.

To break the ice, ask me about what I'm working on currently -- I'm usually working on a side project or three!

And if you're in Toronto, ON, I will buy you coffee (Jimmy's Coffee on Queen W or on Portland are my favourite spots, but any Starbucks will do in a pinch). I'm usually found puttering about in the square demarcated by Dufferin and Spadina, King W and Queen W, but I can drive out to meet you anywhere within a reasonable distance from that area.

If I don't message you back right away, it's probably because I've been caught up in something pressing. It's probably not because I hate you :-) so if I don't get back to you in a couple of days, please do me a favour and message me again. I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.

Hit me up!
